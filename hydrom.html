        <p id="p1">The operational reliability
            of the generating units of the hydro power stations shall be such that
            whenever the grid demands, it should be available for generation. During replacement of any part or equipment after its full utilisation or breakdown, it should be ensured that the replaced part or equipment should be of improved version & of latest technology having longer durability to meet all desired requirements so as to increase plant efficiency and reliability.</p>

        <p id="p2">How Often Do Hydro Power Systems Need Maintenance?</p>
        <p>When well maintained, hydropower facilities can last for more than 100 years and operate for decades without major work, whereas plants that are allowed to deteriorate require constant attention and frequent major refurbishment. That makes it essential for these facilities to have robust O&M strategies in place, recognizing that implementing such strategies go hand in hand with inherent challenges.
