        <h1> Photovoltaic Solar Cells</h1>
        <p> Emerging technologies are revolutionizing PV technology by enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. Innovations such as multi-junction cells, tandem cells, and perovskite-silicon hybrid cells are enabling higher energy conversion efficiency and making solar power more affordable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <h1>Concentrated Solar Power</h1>
        <p>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems utilize mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a receiver, generating heat that drives a turbine for electricity production. Emerging technologies in CSP, such as molten salt storage and advanced heat transfer fluids, improve the efficiency and storage capabilities of these systems, enabling continuous power generation even when the sun is not shining.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
        <h1> Floating Wind Farms</h1>
        <p>Floating wind farms are an innovative solution for harnessing wind energy in deeper waters where fixed foundations are not feasible. This technology involves anchoring wind turbines to floating structures, allowing for flexible deployment and access to wind resources in previously untapped locations. It opens up vast offshore areas for wind power generation and expands the potential for clean energy production.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fourth">
        <h1>Vertical Axis Wind Turbines</h1>
        <p> VAWTs have unique advantages, including compact size, omnidirectional wind capturing, and reduced noise levels. The vibrations will be transfered to kinetic energy via a generator.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fifth">
        <h1>Flow Batteries</h1>
        <p>Flow batteries offer an alternative approach to energy storage, utilizing liquid electrolytes stored in external tanks. They provide scalability, long cycle life, and the ability to decouple power and energy capacity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sixth">
        <h1>AI and Big Data</h1>
        <p>The energy grid is one of the most complex infrastructures and requires quick decision-making in real-time, which big data and AI algorithms enable for utilities. Beyond grid analytics and management, AIâ€™s applications in the renewables sector include power consumption forecasting and predictive maintenance of renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>It further enables IoE applications that predict grid capacity levels and carry out time-based autonomous trading and pricing. With innovations in cloud computing, virtual power plants (VPP) supplement the power generation from utilities. In addition, startups utilize data analytics and machine learning for renewable energy model designing and performance analysis.</p>
