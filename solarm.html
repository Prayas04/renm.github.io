        <p id="p1">While a solar energy system is a significant financial investment, proper maintenance and service can help your solar panels deliver reliable, clean power for more than 25 years. We will look at the service and care that your solar power system might need, the common causes of solar power system damage</p>

        <p id="p2">How Often Do Solar Power Systems Need Maintenance?</p>
        <p>With no moving parts, solar photovoltaic (PV) power systems are very reliable, and with proper maintenance and service, they can provide trouble-free performance for 25+ years. That said, it's good to do a yearly check of your solar power to make sure everything is working correctly, get your panels cleaned for optimum performance, and catch issues before they become a more serious problem.
            The other piece of equipment in your solar pv power system that needs more regular maintenance are solar inverters, since they’re the most complex component of the system, and also the most critical. Inverters typically have a shorter lifespan than panels, so it’s good to do a yearly check of all equipment to catch any potential issues before they become larger problems.
